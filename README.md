# Big Data Project 

This repository contains two major phases of a Big Data course project completed during the Computer and Software Engineering studies.


---

##  Phase 1: Structured Querying & Data Warehouse Design

- Developed complex SQL queries using MySQL and SQL Server
- Built views and stored procedures
- Imported a large-scale dataset (2M+ rows)
- Designed and implemented a **Star Schema**-based Data Warehouse
- Created ETL workflows using MySQL and Python
- Technologies: SQL Server, MySQL Workbench, Python (pyodbc), Event Scheduler

 `Dokumentimi.pdf` inside this folder explains Phase 1 in detail.

##  Phase 2: XML Data Manipulation & BI Visualization

- Parsed and validated XML data (Mondial database)
- Used **XQuery** and **XPath** with BaseX
- Validated XML structure with `xmllint` and XSD
- Built interactive dashboards with:
  -  Power BI (temperature, lake/river visualizations)
  -  Looker Studio (COVID-19 and student performance)
- Technologies: BaseX, Power BI, Looker Studio, XML, XQuery

 `Dokumentimi.pdf` and `.pbix` files inside explain the visualizations.
