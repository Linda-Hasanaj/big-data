# Big Data Project 

This repository contains two major phases of a Big Data course project completed during the Computer and Software Engineering studies.


---

##  Phase 1: Structured Querying & Data Warehouse Design

- Developed complex SQL queries using MySQL and SQL Server
- Built views and stored procedures
- Imported a large-scale dataset (2M+ rows)
- Designed and implemented a **Star Schema**-based Data Warehouse
- Created ETL workflows using MySQL and Python
- Technologies: SQL Server, MySQL Workbench, Python (pyodbc), Event Scheduler

 `Dokumentimi.pdf` inside this folder explains Phase 1 in detail.

##  Phase 2: XML Data Manipulation & BI Visualization

- Parsed and validated XML data (Mondial database)
- Used **XQuery** and **XPath** with BaseX
- Validated XML structure with `xmllint` and XSD
- Built interactive dashboards with:
  -  Power BI (temperature, lake/river visualizations)
  -  Looker Studio (COVID-19 and student performance)
- Technologies: BaseX, Power BI, Looker Studio, XML, XQuery

 `Dokumentimi.pdf` and `.pbix` files inside explain the visualizations.

## Phase 3: Big Data, NoSQL & Network Analysis

- Used Apache Spark with PySpark to process large datasets (`usa_county_wise.csv`) and Mondial
- Performed SparkSQL queries
- Structured NoSQL collections in MongoDB using JSON files
- Wrote advanced MongoDB aggregation queries
- Performed Social Network Analysis (SNA) using ORA Lite
  - Calculated Betweenness, Closeness, Degree centralities
  - Imported datasets into ORA and visualized network graphs
 - Technologies: PySpark, MongoDB, ORA Lite, JSON
## Getting Started

No code to run directly. This project focuses on data engineering concepts, query writing, XML/NoSQL/SparkSQL processing, network analysis, and dashboard design.
